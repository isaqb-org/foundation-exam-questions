= New Foundation Examination Questions

== Status

Work in progress.

We are currently working on creating or selecting a suitable markup
format for the new examination questions.

== XML Schema

The XML Schema (`+exam.rng+`) is good enough for creating examples and
automatic processing.  We expect to add a few more elements and
attributes for cross-referencing, exam generation and semantic
information.

== Examples

We're currently transcribing the mock exam
(https://public.isaqb.org/examination-foundation/mock_exam/mock-exam-answers-en.pdf)
into the new format, results are in the `+examples+` directory.

== Contributing

Create a subdirectory in `+examples+` whose name makes clear the
source, and file away!
