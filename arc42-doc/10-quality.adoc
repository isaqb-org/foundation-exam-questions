=== Quality Scenarios

==== Reliability Scenarios

[options="header",cols="1,2,3"]
|===
|Quality Goal |Scenario |Evaluation

|XML Correctness
|A question author creates a new question with invalid XML structure. The system immediately reports specific validation errors, pointing to the exact location and nature of the problem.
|All validation errors must be detected and reported clearly.

|Data Integrity
|A question's translations in different languages are modified. The system ensures all language versions remain consistent and complete.
|Basic structural consistency must be maintained.

|Build Stability
|Different developers on different platforms execute the build process. The build produces identical results regardless of the platform.
|Build must work consistently across platforms.
|===

==== Usability Scenarios

[options="header",cols="1,2,3"]
|===
|Quality Goal |Scenario |Evaluation

|Developer Experience
|A person with a junior developer skill level clones the repository and follows the setup instructions. They can set up and run the system within 30 minutes.
|Basic setup must be straightforward with minimal steps.

|Tool Simplicity
|An author needs to validate questions and generate PDF output. They can find and execute the correct commands without consulting documentation.
|Commands must follow intuitive patterns (e.g., `gradle validate`).

|Error Messages
|A question file contains multiple issues. Error messages clearly indicate all problems, their locations, and suggest potential fixes.
|Messages must be understandable by non-technical users.

|Question Creation Time
|A new user follows the question template to create their first question. They should be able to complete this task within 60 minutes.
|Time tracking during user testing must confirm this limit.

|Expert Question Creation
|An experienced user creates a new question using the system. They complete the task in under 15 minutes.
|Regular measurement of creation times for experienced users.

|Question Relationship Management
|An author creates a variant of an existing question. The system automatically suggests the relationship, allows specifying the similarity degree, and marks them as mutually exclusive for exam composition.
|Relationship management must be intuitive and support exam composition rules.

|===

==== Maintainability Scenarios

[options="header",cols="1,2,3"]
|===
|Quality Goal |Scenario |Evaluation

|Extensibility
|A new output format needs to be added. The transformation pipeline can be extended without modifying existing transformations.
|Changes should not affect existing functionality.

|Documentation
|A new developer needs to add a command. They can find relevant documentation and examples in the standard locations.
|Documentation must be current and findable.

|Code Structure
|A bug is reported in PDF generation. Developers can locate the relevant code quickly due to clear component separation.
|Clear separation of concerns in implementation.
|===

==== Performance Scenarios

[options="header",cols="1,2,3"]
|===
|Quality Goal |Scenario |Evaluation

|Response Time
|An author validates a single question file. The system provides results within 3 seconds.
|Validation must be fast enough for interactive use.

|Build Performance
|A complete build including all validations and transformations is executed. It completes within 2 minutes.
|Full builds should not block development flow.
|===

=== Additional Performance Scenarios
[options="header",cols="1,2,2"]
|===
|Quality Goal |Scenario |Evaluation Criteria
|Interactive Response
|Author edits question and requests validation
|Results appear within 3 seconds to maintain workflow
|Preview Generation
|Author switches between different output formats (HTML/PDF)
|Preview appears within 5 seconds for any format
|Batch Processing
|Author runs validation on entire question directory
|Processing time stays under 30 seconds for 50 questions
|Build Performance
|Developer runs complete build with all validations
|Full build completes within 2 minutes
|Transform Response
|System performs XSLT transformation for output
|Individual transformations complete within 2 seconds
|===

==== Language Synchronization Scenarios

[options="header",cols="1,2,3"]
|===
|Quality Goal |Scenario |Evaluation

|Translation Completeness
|A new question is added in German. The system tracks the missing English translation and reports it in the pending translations overview. The translation is completed within the 3-month timeframe.
|Translation tracking must clearly show pending translations and their deadlines.

|Cross-language Updates
|A technical term is updated in the German version of a question. The change is identified as requiring synchronization and the English version is updated within one month.
|Changes requiring cross-language updates must be clearly flagged and tracked.

|Translation Visualization
|A reviewer needs to check the consistency between language versions. They can easily view both versions side-by-side with highlighted differences.
|Side-by-side comparison must be available and highlight relevant differences.
|===


==== Extensibility Scenarios

[options="header",cols="1,2,3"]
|===
|Quality Goal |Scenario |Evaluation

|Question Type Extension
a|A new question type needs to be added to support image-based questions. This requires:

- Schema extension for image metadata
- Validation rule updates
- Output generation for PDF/HTML
- Example question creation

The implementation team can complete this within 5 working days without requiring changes to existing question types or breaking the transformation pipeline.
a|
Success criteria:

- Existing questions and outputs remain unchanged
- New type works in all output formats
- Validation provides clear feedback
- Documentation updated
- Example questions provided
