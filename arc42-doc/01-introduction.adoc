== Introduction and Goals

=== Requirements Overview

The system supports the creation and maintenance of exam questions for the iSAQB Foundation Level examination using a structured XML format. The goal is to enable efficient question creation and management to build a high-quality question pool of over 300 questions within 1 year.


==== Priority 1 (Initial Implementation)
* XML-based question authoring with schema validation
* Command-line interface for validation and transformation tasks
* PDF output generation via transformation pipeline
* HTML preview generation with basic styling
* Version control integration via GitLab
* Detailed schema validation error reporting


==== Priority 2 (Essential Supporting Features)
* Create and implement simple concept for defining exam sets
* Provide interface for comparing questions across language versions
* Support a systematic question organization and categorization system
* Track and manage relationships between similar or variant questions
* Block usage of similar questions in the same exam
* Implement question templates to standardize creation process
* Enable analysis of learning goal coverage across the question pool

==== Priority 3 (Important Enhancements)
* Support creation and validation of complete exam question sets
* Visualize relationships and dependencies between questions
* Generate statistics about question relationships and coverage

==== Priority 4 (Backlog)
* Track translation deadlines (3-month completion targets)
* Monitor cross-language updates (1-month update time requirement)
* Generate reports on pending translations
* Provide file-based question export for exam providers
* Validate multilingual content for plausibility
* Export basic statistics about questions like count per type and learning goal
* Export question usage history and frequency in exams
* Generate and validate unique question identifiers
* Enable search across all question content and metadata
* Detect similar questions automatically
* Report on translation completion status
* Execute batch operations on question sets
* Support additional question types beyond current schema
* Track review status for each question
* Display review status in standard tools
* Support review workflow progression from draft to approved
* Track separate review status per language version
* Use question metadata for automated exam composition


==== Priority 5 (Future Considerations)
* Transform plain text input to markup format using AI assistance
* Map and validate questions against curriculum versions
* Analyze distribution of correct and incorrect answers
* Implement formal review workflow
* Support media attachments in questions

==== Explicitly Excluded
* Exam management system integration

=== Quality Goals

[options="header",cols="2,4,^1"]
|===
|Quality Goal |Scenarios |Priority

|Reliability > Correctness
a|

- The system detects all XML schema violations immediately and provides error messages that point to the exact location.
- Only questions that validate correctly can be added to the repository.
|1

|Usable > Interaction Efficiency
a|
Authors can work efficiently with the system:

- New authors successfully create and validate their first question within 60 minutes 
- Experienced authors complete questions in under 15 minutes
- Preview updates appear within 5 seconds of changes
- Validation results appear within 3 seconds
- Authors find and execute the correct commands without consulting documentation
- Complete build including all validations completes within 2 minutes
|1

|Operable > Installability
a|
A new team member with basic command-line experience can:

- Set up the complete system within 30 minutes
- Successfully validate their first question
- Generate both PDF and HTML output

All by following the provided documentation without additional support.
|1

|Flexible > Modifiability
a|
The transformation pipeline allows:

- Adding new output formats without modifying existing ones
- Extending the question schema without breaking existing transforms and questions


|2

|Operable > Portability
a|
The system works consistently across different platforms:

- Identical validation results on Windows, Linux and macOS
- Consistent PDF/HTML output regardless of operating system
- Build process succeeds with same results on all platforms
- No platform-specific configuration required beyond documented requirements
