= ADR001 - Use Gradle for (initial) Command-Line Interface

[.lead]
A decision record for implementing the command-line interface using Gradle.

== Status

Accepted

== Context

For the initial prototype (Priority 1) stage, we need a command-line interface that must:

* Handle XML validation against schema
* Generate PDF/HTML output
* Provide clear error messages
* Work on different platforms
* Allow adding new commands with low effort
* Be usable by junior developers with basic setup instructions

== Decision

Use Gradle as the initial command-line interface implementation.

== Rationale

.Considered approaches:
[cols="1,4"]
|===
|Option |Analysis

|1. Gradle (Chosen)
a|
* Most developers already know it
* Works well on all platforms
* Handles dependencies
* Well-documented with large community
* Easy to add new tasks
* Standard build tool practices

|2. Custom CLI Tool (e.g., Picocli)
a|
* Would give full control
* Requires higher development effort
* New codebase developers must learn

|3. Shell/Python Scripts
a|
* Simple to start with
* Cross-platform issues
* Hard to maintain as system grows
|===

Gradle best matches our requirements while using knowledge developers already have.

== Consequences

.Re-evaluation Triggers
* Project grows beyond basic CLI tools
* Integration needs become complex
* User base expands significantly

.Required Actions
[arabic]
. Set up Gradle project structure and wrapper
. Create and document initial task set
. Define patterns for adding new tasks
. Schedule review when moving beyond Priority 1 features
