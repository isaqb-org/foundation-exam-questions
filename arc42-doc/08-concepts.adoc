== Cross-cutting Concepts


ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Content
This section describes overall, principal regulations and solution ideas that are relevant in multiple parts (= cross-cutting) of your system.
Such concepts are often related to multiple building blocks.
They can include many different topics, such as

* models, especially domain models
* architecture or design patterns
* rules for using specific technology
* principal, often technical decisions of an overarching (= cross-cutting) nature
* implementation rules


.Motivation
Concepts form the basis for _conceptual integrity_ (consistency, homogeneity) of the architecture. 
Thus, they are an important contribution to achieve inner qualities of your system.

Some of these concepts cannot be assigned to individual building blocks, e.g. security or safety. 


.Form
The form can be varied:

* concept papers with any kind of structure
* cross-cutting model excerpts or scenarios using notations of the architecture views
* sample implementations, especially for technical concepts
* reference to typical usage of standard frameworks (e.g. using Hibernate for object/relational mapping)

.Structure
A potential (but not mandatory) structure for this section could be:

* Domain concepts
* User Experience concepts (UX)
* Safety and security concepts
* Architecture and design patterns
* "Under-the-hood"
* development concepts
* operational concepts

Note: it might be difficult to assign individual concepts to one specific topic
on this list.

=== Question Relationship Model

==== Purpose
The question relationship model enables tracking and managing similarities between questions to:

- Prevent redundant questions in exams
- Support question reuse and variation
- Maintain overview of question coverage

==== Structure
[plantuml]
....
@startuml
class Question {
  +id: String
  +type: QuestionType
  +languages: Set<Language>
}

class RelationType {
  +type: String
  +description: String
}

class QuestionRelation {
  +type: RelationType
  +similarity: Float
  +notes: String
}

Question "1" *-- "*" QuestionRelation
QuestionRelation "*" -- "1" Question: related to >
RelationType "1" -- "*" QuestionRelation
@enduml
....

==== Relation Types

- *Variant*: Questions with same core concept but different wording
- *Similar*: Questions testing related concepts
- *Dependent*: Questions that build on each other

==== Usage Guidelines

- Questions within the same equivalence class should not appear in the same exam
- Similarity scores help in exam composition
- Relationships should be documented when creating question variants

=== Exam Question Metadata Handling

[NOTE]
====
TODO: This concept needs further refinement during implementation phases 2-3. 
Key questions to address:

- What additional metadata fields might be needed?
- How to ensure consistent metadata across language versions?
- What validation rules apply to metadata?
====

==== Identified Metadata Fields
From requirements:

Essential:
- Question ID (for referencing specific versions)
- Languages (available translations)
- Question type (pickQuestion, categoryQuestion)
- Learning goals
- Points/scoring
- Change history (modifications across all language versions)
- Review/release status
- Question relationships/equivalence classes

Additional:
- Author information
- Solution hints/explanations
- Related curriculum version

The system needs to support automated processing of this metadata for:
- Exam composition and validation
- Learning goal coverage analysis  
- Question filtering and selection
- Translation status tracking
- Review process support

This capability should be considered in:
- Question format design
- Tool implementation  
- Export formats

=== Change History Management

[NOTE]
====
TODO: This concept needs refinement to address:

- How to minimize redundant history storage
- Best practices for handling cross-language changes
- Integration with version control
====

==== Requirements

- Changes must be traceable across all language versions of a question
- History should show whether changes affect single or multiple language versions
- Avoid redundant storage of change information
- Support both technical (Git) and content-level history

==== Change Categories

- Single language updates (e.g., typo fixes)
- Cross-language changes (e.g., technical content updates)
- Structural changes (affecting all versions)
