=== The `make-exam` tool

The `make-exam` command-line tool can build an exam from a LaTeX
template and a set of XML questions.  It can be built like this, from
the `code/foundation-exam` directory:

[source,bash]
----
raco exe --launcher make-exam.rkt
----

The `make-exam` tool is also provided by the `make-exam` package in
the <<section-nix-flake>>.

It is invoked like so:

[source,bash]
----
make-exam --out <out-filename> --template <template> --language en|de <question>.xml ...
----

For example, the English language Mock exam is built like this (in the `mock` directory):

[source,bash]
----
make-exam --template template-en.tex --out mock-en.tex --language en questions/*.xml
----

There's also an option `+--ids-file+` that specifies a file that
contains question ids, which will be selected from the set of
questions.
