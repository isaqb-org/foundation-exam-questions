== Architecture Decisions


ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Important, expensive, large scale or risky architecture decisions including rationales.
With "decisions" we mean selecting one alternative based on given criteria.

Please use your judgement to decide whether an architectural decision should be documented
here in this central section or whether you better document it locally
(e.g. within the white box template of one building block).

Avoid redundancy. 
Refer to section 4, where you already captured the most important decisions of your architecture.

.Motivation
Stakeholders of your system should be able to comprehend and retrace your decisions.

.Form
Various options:

* ADR (https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions[Documenting Architecture Decisions]) for every important decision
* List or table, ordered by importance and consequences or:
* more detailed in form of separate sections per decision

.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-9/[Architecture Decisions] in the arc42 documentation.
There you will find links and examples about ADR.

=== Potentially Required Future Architectural Decisions

==== Priority Categories
- P1: Urgent, needed for Priority 1 features, blocks implementation
- P2: Important, needed soon but doesn't block initial work
- P3: Future concern, can be documented initially in arc42
- P4: May not need ADR, better suited for other documentation


==== Transformation Pipeline Architecture
Priority: P1
Type: ADR needed
Rationale: Core architectural component affecting multiple features. Defines how different outputs (PDF, HTML) are generated and how future formats can be added.
Key aspects:
- Component structure
- Integration of existing XSLT/XSL-FO
- Extension points for new formats
- Error handling strategy

==== Validation Strategy
Priority: P1
Type: ADR needed
Rationale: Central to XML processing, affects multiple components and error handling.
Key aspects:
- RelaxNG integration
- Error reporting structure
- Integration with build process
- Future validation extensibility

==== XML Storage Structure
Priority: P3
Type: Start as arc42 documentation, may need ADR later
Rationale: Important but can evolve as requirements become clearer.
Document in: Building Block View and Concepts
Key aspects:
- File organization
- Naming conventions
- GitLab structure
- Search/filter implications

==== Build and Release Process
Priority: P2
Type: Start as arc42 documentation, may need ADR later
Rationale: Important for development but can start simple and evolve.
Document in: Development View and Deployment View
Key aspects:
- Tool distribution
- Dependency management
- Version numbering
- Release process

==== Multi-Language Support
Priority: P4
Type: arc42 documentation
Rationale: Largely defined by schema, needs documentation rather than decisions.
Document in: Cross-cutting Concepts
Key aspects:
- Translation handling
- Language-specific validation
- Output generation rules

==== Question Set Composition
Priority: P3
Type: May need ADR when implemented
Rationale: Part of Priority 3 features, needs more requirements first.
Key aspects:
- Set structure
- Metadata handling
- Validation rules
- Export formats

==== Error Handling Strategy
Priority: P2
Type: ADR needed
Rationale: Cross-cutting concern affecting multiple components.
Key aspects:
- Error categorization
- Reporting formats
- User feedback
- Error recovery

==== Tool Integration Architecture
Priority: P2
Type: ADR needed
Rationale: Defines how external tools (XSLT, validators) are integrated.
Key aspects:
- Tool wrapping approach
- Error propagation
- Version management
- Platform independence
