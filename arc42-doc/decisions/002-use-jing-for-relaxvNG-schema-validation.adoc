= ADR002 - Use Jing for RelaxNG Schema Validation

[.lead]
A decision record for implementing XML schema validation against RelaxNG schemas.

== Status

Proposed

== Context

For validating exam questions against the RelaxNG schema, we need a solution that:

* Handles both single-file and batch validation
* Works consistently across different platforms
* Integrates with Gradle build system
* Provides clear error messages
* Can be reused as a component in other parts of the system

Current approach using xmllint requires system-level installation that may not be available on all platforms.

Performance requirements:

* Single file validation must complete within 3 seconds
* Complete build including all validations must complete within 2 minutes

== Decision

Use Jing as the RelaxNG schema validation implementation.

== Rationale

.Considered approaches:
[cols="1,4"]
|===
|Option |Analysis

|1. Jing (Chosen)
a|
* Platform independent (JVM-based)
* Reference implementation for RELAX NG
* Excellent performance characteristics
* Strong community support
* Clean Gradle integration
* Moderate learning curve

|2. Scala/nu.validator
a|
* Good functional programming support
* Platform independent
* More demanding learning curve
* Smaller community
* More complex integration

|3. Embedded xmllint
a|
* Familiar from current usage
* Excellent performance
* Platform dependency issues
* Complex distribution

|4. Other Options
a|
* Node.js: Additional runtime dependency
* Haskell: Limited community, steep learning curve
* Web Service: Performance/complexity concerns
|===

Jing scored highest in our weighted evaluation, particularly excelling in critical requirements (platform independence, performance) while offering good community support and a moderate learning curve.

== Consequences

.Re-evaluation Triggers
* Performance falls below requirements
* Schema complexity increases significantly
* New validation requirements emerge

.Required Actions
[arabic]
. Add Jing dependency to build
. Create validation task implementation
. Document error message patterns
. Define validation component API
. Create examples for common use cases
. Schedule review after first major release
