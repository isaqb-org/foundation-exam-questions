== Architecture Constraints

=== Technical Constraints
|===
|Constraint |Background/Motivation |Details

|Version Control System: GitLab
|Project was initialized using GitLab
a|
* Source code and question content stored in GitLab repository
* Branch/merge workflow for collaborative development
* Built-in CI/CD capabilities available

|Question Format
|Existing RelaxNG schema under development defines question structure
a|
* XML-based format
* Support for multilingual content (DE/EN/<other> required)
* Two defined question types (pickQuestion, categoryQuestion)
* Specific metadata structure (learning goals, history)

|PDF Generation
|Existing transformation process should be supported/adapted
a|
* Possibly based on XSLT/XSL-FO
* Current styling should be maintained
* Should work with XML question format

|Cross-Platform Support
|Users work on different operating systems
a|
* Command-line tools must work on all major platforms
* No platform-specific dependencies
* Consistent behavior across systems

=== Organizational Constraints
|===
|Constraint |Background/Motivation |Details

|Development Process
|Initial prototype stage with phased implementation
a|
* Focus on Priority 1 features first
* Work done by unpaid contributors
* Command-line based workflow for initial version
* Changes must be reviewable in GitLab

|User Skills (Authors, Reviewers)
|Different technical backgrounds of users
a|
* Authors with junior developer skills must be able to set up system
* Basic documentation must be sufficient
* Command-line experience can be assumed

|Volunteer Developers
|Development team consists of volunteers with diverse programming backgrounds
a|
* Mix of object-oriented and functional programming backgrounds
* Different levels of XML/XSLT experience
* Variable time availability for contribution
* Code must be accessible to different programming paradigms
* Documentation needs to accommodate different approaches
