= New Foundation Examination Questions

== Status

Work in progress.

We are currently working on creating or selecting a suitable markup
format for the new examination questions.

== XML Schema

The RELAX NG XML Schema (`+exam.rng+`) is good enough for creating examples and
automatic processing.  We expect to add a few more elements and
attributes for cross-referencing, exam generation and semantic
information.

== Examples

We're currently transcribing the mock exam
(https://public.isaqb.org/examination-foundation/mock_exam/mock-exam-answers-en.pdf)
into the new format, results are in the `+examples+` directory.

== Code

Racket code for parsing XML exam questions and producing output from
them is in the `+code+` directory.

== Build System

The project uses Gradle for building and validation. The Gradle wrapper is included, so you don't need to install Gradle separately.

=== Prerequisites

* Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
** Note: Gradle works with any JVM version between 8 and 23

=== Getting Started

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew tasks # Lists all available tasks
----

=== XML Validation

Validate a single XML file:
[source,bash]
----
./gradlew validateFile -Pfile=mock/mock-01.xml
----

Validate all XML files in the mock directory:
[source,bash]
----
./gradlew validate
----

Both tasks will validate the XML files against the RELAX NG schema (`exam.rng`).

== Building Documentation

The project uses Gradle to generate the documentation in both HTML and PDF formats:

[source,bash]
----
# First time and regular builds
./gradlew buildDocs

# Clean and rebuild
./gradlew clean buildDocs
----

The generated documentation will be available in:

* `build/arc42-doc/html/` - HTML documentation
* `build/arc42-doc/pdf/` - PDF documentation


== Contributing

Create a subdirectory in `+examples+` whose name makes clear the
source, and file away!
