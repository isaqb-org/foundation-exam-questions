= ADR003 - Use XSLT for Question Preview

== Status

Accepted

== Context

For the question preview system, we need a technology stack that:

* Transforms XML questions into visual previews
* Supports fast single-question rendering
* Enables multi-language comparison
* Works with existing Jing validation
* Must be maintainable by volunteer developers
* Should support future PDF generation
* Must work cross-platform

Current technical constraints:
* Gradle-based build system
* RelaxNG schema for validation
* Various developer skill levels
* Focus on Priority 1 features

== Decision

Use XSLT for XML transformation

=== XSLT
* Primary transformation technology for XML to HTML/PDF
* Single source for multiple output formats
* Well-suited for future PDF generation via XSL-FO
* Integrates with existing Java/Gradle tooling

== Rationale

.XSLT advantages:
* Native XML processing capabilities
* Excellent for structural transformations
* Single transformation source for HTML and PDF
* Part of Java ecosystem, integrates with Gradle/Jing
* Standard technology with long-term support


.Alternatives Considered:
[cols="1,2"]
|===
|Alternative |Reason Not Chosen

|Java-based XML Processing
|More verbose, requires object models, less suitable for PDF generation

|Custom DSL/Parser
|High development effort, another language to learn, need to maintain parser
|===

== Consequences

.Positive:
* Minimal external dependencies
* Standard technologies
* Multiple output format support
* Good separation of concerns
* Works everywhere
* No build complexity for UI

.Negative:
* XSLT learning curve for some developers

== Related Decisions

* ADR001: Uses Gradle for CLI - XSLT processing will integrate here
* ADR002: Uses Jing for validation - XML processing pipeline
