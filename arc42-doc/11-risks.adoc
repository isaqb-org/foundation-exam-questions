== Risks and Technical Debts

=== Technical Risks

[options="header",cols="1,2,2"]
|===
|Risk |Description |Mitigation

|Cross-Platform Compatibility
|While Gradle provides cross-platform support, the integration with XSL-FO processors and other tools might cause platform-specific issues.
a|
* Early testing on different platforms
* Clear documentation of platform requirements
* Container-based development environment if needed

|XML Schema Evolution
a|
The RelaxNG schema is still under development. Changes might affect:

* Existing questions
* Validation logic
* Transformation pipelines
a|
* Version schema files
* Plan migration strategy
* Track schema dependencies

|Question Organization
a|
Current file-based organization might not scale well with:

* Large number of questions
* Multiple authors
* Complex search requirements
a|
* Postponed to Priority 3
* Document organization needs
* Consider search requirements early

|Tool Dependencies
a|

System relies on external tools:
* XSL-FO processor
* RelaxNG validators
* XSLT processors
a|
* Document exact version requirements
* Consider bundling required tools
* Test upgrade procedures

=== Technical Debts

|===
|Debt |Impact |Notes

|Basic HTML Styling
|Initial HTML output will have minimal styling.
a|
* Accepted for Priority 1
* Document styling requirements
* Plan enhancement in later phase

|Command-Line Focus
|No GUI for non-technical users initially.
a|
* Identified as future need
* Document UI requirements
* Consider API design for future UI

|Limited Error Reporting
|Initial error messages might be too technical.
a|
* May affect user acceptance
* Collect user feedback
* Plan improvements

|Missing Search Functionality
|File system browsing only for finding questions.
a|
* Acceptable for initial version
* Document search requirements
* Consider metadata structure
