<!-- END-ADR-INDEX -->

## Naming Convention

ADRs follow these conventions:

* Three-digit number starting with 001 (e.g., 001, 002, 023)
* Referenced as ADR followed by number (e.g., ADR001)
* Filename format: `NNN-title-with-dashes.adoc`
* Title format inside file: `ADRXXX - Title of Decision`

## Statuses

- **Proposed** - under discussion
- **Accepted** - decision is accepted and will be implemented
- **Deprecated** - decision was accepted but is no longer valid
- **Superseded** - decision was accepted but was later superseded by another decision

## Process

1. Create new ADR by copying template.adoc
2. Name file according to pattern: NNN-title-with-dashes.adoc
3. Write ADR following template structure
4. Run `./gradlew updateAdrIndex` to update the index
5. Link from relevant arc42 documentation sections


<!--
Implementation Notes:
- This file serves as the master index for all ADRs
- Will be used to generate section 09-decisions.md in the arc42 documentation
- Should be kept up to date as new ADRs are added
- Links between ADRs should be maintained here
