== Solution Strategy

=== Fundamental Technical Decisions

[options="header",cols="1,2,2"]
|===
|Decision |Background |Details

|Gradle-based Command Line
|Need for extensible, cross-platform tooling
a|
* Use Gradle for command execution and build
* Standardized task structure
* Well-known to developers
* See ADR-001 for details

|XML-based Storage
|Question management and transformation needs
a|
* RelaxNG schema validation
* Clear structure for transformations
* Support for multilingual content
* Version control friendly

|Transformation Pipeline
|Multiple output format requirements
a|
* XSLT/XSL-FO for PDF generation
* HTML generation for preview
* Extensible for future formats
|===

=== Implementation Strategy

==== Phase 1: Core Foundation (Priority 1)
* Focus on command-line tooling and validation
* Implement basic transformation pipeline
* Establish development workflow with GitLab
* Essential features only (VAL, PDF, HTM, ERR)

==== Phase 2: Enhanced Functionality (Priority 3)
* Develop web-based preview capabilities
* Implement question organization strategy
* Add learning goal analysis tools
* Support question sets/exam composition

==== Phase 3: Advanced Features (Priority 4+)
* AI-assisted question transformation
* Enhanced validation and similarity checks
* Search and statistics functionality
* Additional output formats as needed

=== Quality Goals Achievement
